# UberEats Earnings Optimization Analysis

## Project Overview
This project delves into the exploration and analysis of UberEats delivery data with the primary goal of identifying strategies to maximize earnings for delivery partners. By employing a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach, this study highlights the impact of various factors such as time of day, day of the week, and geographical locations on earnings potential.

## Objectives
- **Analyze UberEats delivery data** to uncover patterns and insights related to earnings.
- **Identify key factors** that significantly affect delivery earnings.
- **Provide actionable recommendations** for delivery partners to optimize their schedules and routes for increased earnings.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Utilized for efficient data processing and numerical operations.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: For generating insightful visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting the analysis process and findings.

## Key Findings
- Earnings vary significantly by time of day and day of the week, with dinner times and weekends being the most lucrative.
- Certain geographical areas yield higher average earnings, indicating the importance of strategic location selection.
- Feature engineering revealed additional insights into earnings per hour and distance-based earnings optimization.
